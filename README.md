# Complex-Numbers-Class
A simple class that helps create, use and operate on Complex Numbers, using C++

# Description
The following is a simpler implementation of complex numbers in C++; 
Numbers of the form a + b i, where a and b are real and i = sqrt(-1).
This class declaration allows the user to perform most of the possible operations as possible using complex numbers...
The equations can be of any difficulty, as most of the functions are here.
All depends on the user's imagination and knowledge of implementation...
